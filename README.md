#### Prerequisite knowledge/ Prework:

Normal distribution

Standard normal distribution

Statistical Testing with z-score and p-value 

One-sample z-test


#### Learning goals for this lesson:

* Students can define the null and alternative hypothesis. 
* Students understand the difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.  
* Students can define the significance threshold $\alpha$ and its relation to p-value. 
* Students can differentiate between z-tests and t-tests.
* Students can perform z-tests and t-tests.
* Students can use scipy methods to compute the p value of a z-score and are able to interpet the significance of results.

#### Lesson Outline:

* Hypothesis testing
    * Jumpstart the discussion with an example: null and alternative hypothesis, word problem for one-tailed one-sample z-test.
    * 

* One-sample z-test

* One-sample and two-sample t-tests
    * When do we use z-tests and when do we use t-tests?
