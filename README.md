#### Lesson Summary:

A discussion of hypothesis testing is motivated by an example where students perform a one-sample z-test. From there, ...

#### Prerequisite knowledge/ Prework:

Normal distribution

Standard normal distribution

Statistical Testing with z-score and p-value 

One-sample z-test


#### Learning goals for this lesson:

* Students can define the null and alternative hypothesis. 
* Students understand the difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.  
* Students can define the significance threshold $\alpha$ and its relation to p-value. 
* Students can differentiate when to use z-tests vs. t-tests.
* Students can perform z-tests and t-tests using python libraries. 

Relevant learning goals from Airtable:

#### Misconceptions / Notes

* A common misconception is that you can accept the alternative hypothesis. This is not true. We either _reject_ or _fail to reject_ the null hypothesis at a given significance level $\alpha$. 


#### Materials
- Ipython notebook

#### Vocab / Concepts 

* Hypothesis testing
* Null hypothesis
* Alternative hypothesis
* p-values 
* One-sample z-test
* One- and two-sample t-tests

#### Lesson Outline:

* Hypothesis testing
    * Jumpstart the discussion with an example: give students a word problem for a one-sided one-sample z-test. 
        * Ask students to write the null and alternative hypothesis. 
        * Discuss the importance of the significance threshold $\alpha$: business applications.

* When do we use z-tests and when do we use t-tests? 
    * z-test: assumption of normality and large enough sample size

* One-sample z-test
    * comparing the mean of a large enough sample (n $\geq$ 30) to a population mean

* One-sample and two-sample t-tests

* Summary
